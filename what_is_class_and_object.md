# Class and Object in Java

## Class:

    A class in Java is a blueprint or template that defines the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) of objects. It does not occupy memory until an object is created.

    Example: Think of a car blueprint. The blueprint outlines the properties (like color, brand, model) and functions (like start, stop, accelerate) of a car.

## Object:

    An object is an instance of a class. When you create an object, memory is allocated, and the object's properties and methods can be accessed and used.

    Example: A specific car, like a red Tesla Model S, is an object created based on the car blueprint.

# Real-Life Example of Class and Object: "Library and Books"

Scenario:

Imagine a library. A class represents the concept or blueprint of a book, while an object represents an actual book in the library.

Class: Book

    A class is like the general definition of what a book is.
    It defines common properties and behaviors shared by all books, such as:

    1. Properties: Title, Author, Genre, ISBN.
    2. Behaviors: Open, Read, Close.

Object: Individual Books

    Objects are specific instances of the book class.
    Each object represents a real book with unique property values.

Example:

    Class (Blueprint): "Book"

    Properties:
        Title
        Author
        Genre
        ISBN

    Behaviors:
        Open the book
        Read the book
        Close the book

Objects (Instances):

    Object 1: "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"
    Title: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone
    Author: J.K. Rowling
    Genre: Fantasy
    ISBN: 12345

    Object 2: "The Great Gatsby"
    Title: The Great Gatsby
    Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
    Genre: Fiction
    ISBN: 67890

Interacting with Objects

    When you interact with the books in the library:
    You pick up Object 1 (Harry Potter) and open it, then start reading it.
    Later, you switch to Object 2 (The Great Gatsby), open it, and start reading that.
    Each book is a specific object created based on the general concept (class) of a "Book."
