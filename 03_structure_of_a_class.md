### Structure of a Class in Java (Excluding Constructor)

A **class** in Java is a blueprint for creating objects. It encapsulates **data members** (fields/attributes) and **methods** (functions/operations) to define the behavior of objects.

---

### **Key Components of a Class**

#### 1. **Data Members**

- **Definition**: Variables defined inside the class to store the state of the object. They can be of various types: primitive or objects (reference types).
- **Access Modifiers**:
  - `private`: Encapsulation; restrict access.
  - `public`: Accessible anywhere.
  - `protected`: Accessible in subclasses and same package.
  - `default`: Accessible within the same package.

#### 2. **Methods**

- **Definition**: Blocks of code inside a class that define behaviors or actions performed by objects of the class. Methods can operate on data members.
- **Types of Methods**:
  - **Instance Methods**: Operate on instance data members.
  - **Static Methods**: Operate independently of any instance and use `static` keyword.
  - **Getter/Setter Methods**: Encapsulate access to private data members.

### **Example Code**

```java
// Example class representing a basic Bank Account
public class BankAccount {
    // Data Members
    private String accountNumber;  // Account number of the user
    private double balance;        // Current balance in the account

    // Getter method for accountNumber
    public String getAccountNumber() {
        return accountNumber;
    }

    // Setter method for accountNumber
    public void setAccountNumber(String accountNumber) {
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
    }

    // Getter method for balance
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    // Method to deposit money
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount; // Add to the current balance
            System.out.println(amount + " deposited. New Balance: " + balance);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Deposit amount must be positive!");
        }
    }

    // Method to withdraw money
    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount; // Deduct from the current balance
            System.out.println(amount + " withdrawn. New Balance: " + balance);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient balance or invalid amount!");
        }
    }
}
```

### **Pros of Using Classes**

1. **Encapsulation**: Combines data and methods into a single unit.
2. **Reusability**: Can create multiple objects with similar attributes and behavior.
3. **Modularity**: Encourages a clean and organized codebase.
4. **Abstraction**: Provides a clear interface for interacting with the object.
5. **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Extends functionality easily.

### **Cons of Using Classes**

1. **Overhead**: Can introduce complexity with deeper inheritance hierarchies.
2. **Memory Usage**: Object instantiation can use more memory.
3. **Coupling**: Poorly designed classes can lead to tightly coupled code.

### **Applications in Bigger Systems**

1. **Banking Systems**: Classes like `Account`, `Transaction`, and `Customer` to model real-world entities.
2. **E-commerce Platforms**: `Product`, `Order`, `Customer` classes.
3. **Game Development**: Classes like `Player`, `Enemy`, and `Weapon`.
4. **Library Management**: Classes like `Book`, `LibraryMember`, and `Loan`.

By combining these classes, larger systems can be designed with ease, maintaining modularity and scalability.
