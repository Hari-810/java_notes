## **Servlet Basics and Lifecycle ‚Äì A Comprehensive Guide**

### **Definition of Servlet**

A **Servlet** is a Java program that runs on a server and handles client requests, typically HTTP requests from web browsers or applications. Servlets are used to create **dynamic web applications** by processing requests, generating responses, and interacting with databases or other backend services.

Servlets are part of **Java EE (Jakarta EE)** and follow the **Java Servlet API**, which provides a framework for building web applications efficiently.

## **Servlet Lifecycle**

The servlet lifecycle consists of **five main stages**:

### **1. Loading and Instantiation**

- The servlet class is **loaded** by the servlet container (e.g., Apache Tomcat) when the first request is made or during server startup (if configured to load on startup).
- An **instance** of the servlet is created.

### **2. Initialization (`init() method`)**

- The container calls the `init(ServletConfig config)` method **only once** when the servlet is first created.
- Used to initialize resources like database connections.

**Example:**

```java
public void init(ServletConfig config) throws ServletException {
    super.init(config);
    System.out.println("Servlet Initialized!");
}
```

### **3. Request Handling (`service() method`)**

- The `service(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)` method is called for **every** client request.
- It **determines** whether to call `doGet()`, `doPost()`, or other request-handling methods.

**Example:**

```java
public void service(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
    throws ServletException, IOException {
    response.setContentType("text/html");
    PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
    out.println("<h2>Hello, Servlet World!</h2>");
}
```

### **4. Processing HTTP Requests (`doGet()` and `doPost() methods`)**

- `doGet()` is called when a **GET request** is made (e.g., accessing a URL).
- `doPost()` is used for **POST requests**, commonly used in form submissions.

**Example:**

```java
protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
    throws ServletException, IOException {
    response.getWriter().println("GET request processed");
}
```

```java
protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
    throws ServletException, IOException {
    response.getWriter().println("POST request processed");
}
```

### **5. Destruction (`destroy() method`)**

- When the servlet is **shut down** or removed from the container, `destroy()` is called.
- Used to **release resources** like database connections.

**Example:**

```java
public void destroy() {
    System.out.println("Servlet Destroyed!");
}
```

## **Real-Time Example: Login Authentication using Servlet**

### **Scenario**

A web application needs to authenticate users based on credentials stored in a database.

### **Implementation Steps**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **User submits a login form (HTML/JSP).**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Servlet processes credentials** and validates them against the database.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Response is sent back** (success or failure).

### **Servlet Code Example:**

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

@WebServlet("/LoginServlet")
public class LoginServlet extends HttpServlet {
    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
        throws ServletException, IOException {

        String username = request.getParameter("username");
        String password = request.getParameter("password");

        response.setContentType("text/html");
        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();

        if ("admin".equals(username) && "1234".equals(password)) {
            out.println("<h2>Login Successful! Welcome, " + username + ".</h2>");
        } else {
            out.println("<h2>Invalid username or password.</h2>");
        }
    }
}
```

### **Explanation**

- The **form data** is received using `request.getParameter()`.
- The servlet **validates the username and password**.
- A **response message is displayed** based on authentication status.

üí° **Use Case:** This can be extended to verify credentials from a **database** using JDBC.

## **Answers to Servlet Interview Questions**

### **Basic Questions**

#### **1. What is a Servlet, and why is it used?**

A **Servlet** is a Java class that runs on a web server and handles HTTP requests and responses. It is used to create **dynamic web applications**, process form submissions, manage sessions, and interact with databases. Servlets replace traditional CGI scripts by offering better performance, security, and scalability.

#### **2. Explain the different types of Servlets.**

There are two main types of Servlets:

- **GenericServlet** ‚Äì A protocol-independent servlet that extends `javax.servlet.GenericServlet`.
- **HttpServlet** ‚Äì A servlet designed specifically for handling HTTP requests and extends `javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet`. It provides methods like `doGet()`, `doPost()`, etc.

#### **3. What is the difference between a Servlet and JSP?**

| Feature             | Servlet                            | JSP                                                       |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type                | Java class                         | HTML file with embedded Java                              |
| Execution           | Compiled and executed as Java code | Compiled into a Servlet before execution                  |
| Ease of Development | More complex                       | Easier due to HTML-like syntax                            |
| Performance         | Slightly faster                    | Slightly slower than servlets due to translation overhead |

#### **4. What are the key advantages of Servlets over CGI?**

- **Better Performance** ‚Äì Uses threads instead of creating a new process for each request.
- **Scalability** ‚Äì Can handle multiple requests efficiently.
- **Security** ‚Äì Provides built-in session tracking and authentication.
- **Reusability** ‚Äì Servlets are object-oriented and reusable across applications.

### **Lifecycle-Based Questions**

#### **5. Explain the lifecycle of a Servlet.**

The servlet lifecycle has five main phases:

1. **Loading & Instantiation** ‚Äì The servlet is loaded when the first request is received or at server startup.
2. **Initialization (`init()`)** ‚Äì Called once to initialize the servlet.
3. **Request Processing (`service()`)** ‚Äì Handles client requests and determines the correct method (`doGet()`, `doPost()`, etc.).
4. **Execution of `doGet()` or `doPost()`** ‚Äì Processes requests based on HTTP methods.
5. **Destruction (`destroy()`)** ‚Äì Called once before the servlet is unloaded to release resources.

#### **6. What is the role of the `init()`, `service()`, and `destroy()` methods?**

- **`init()`** ‚Äì Initializes the servlet, executed only once.
- **`service()`** ‚Äì Handles all client requests, executed on every request.
- **`destroy()`** ‚Äì Cleans up resources before the servlet is removed.

#### **7. How many times is the `init()` method called in a servlet lifecycle?**

The `init()` method is called **only once** when the servlet is first loaded into memory by the server.

#### **8. What happens if a servlet does not override the `service()` method?**

If a servlet does not override the `service()` method, the default `service()` implementation of `HttpServlet` will call either `doGet()` or `doPost()` based on the HTTP request type. If neither `doGet()` nor `doPost()` is overridden, a **405 Method Not Allowed** error will be returned.

---

### **Scenario-Based Questions**

#### **9. How would you handle multiple concurrent user requests in a servlet?**

Servlets are **multithreaded** by default, meaning each request is processed in a separate thread. However, if a servlet uses shared resources (e.g., a database connection), **synchronization** or **connection pooling** should be used to avoid race conditions.

#### **10. How can you manage sessions in a servlet?**

Session management can be handled using:

- **HTTP Sessions (`HttpSession`)** ‚Äì `request.getSession()` creates/retrieves a session.
- **Cookies** ‚Äì Stores session identifiers on the client‚Äôs browser.
- **URL Rewriting** ‚Äì Appends session IDs to URLs.

Example using **`HttpSession`**:

```java
HttpSession session = request.getSession();
session.setAttribute("username", "JohnDoe");
```

#### **11. How would you implement form validation using a servlet?**

A servlet can validate user input from a form before processing it:

```java
String email = request.getParameter("email");
if (email == null || email.isEmpty()) {
    response.getWriter().println("Email is required!");
} else {
    response.getWriter().println("Email is valid: " + email);
}
```

For complex validation, **JavaScript** or **JSP/Servlet combination** can be used.

---

### **Advanced Questions**

#### **12. What is a servlet container, and how does it work?**

A **Servlet Container** (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty, GlassFish) is a part of a web server that:

- **Loads and manages servlets**
- **Handles client requests and responses**
- **Manages session tracking and security**
- **Provides multithreading for efficiency**

#### **13. How does a servlet communicate with a database?**

A servlet connects to a database using **JDBC**:

```java
Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb", "user", "password");
Statement stmt = con.createStatement();
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM users");
```

Best practice: Use **connection pooling** (e.g., DataSource) for better performance.

#### **14. Explain the difference between `forward()` and `sendRedirect()`.**

| Feature            | `forward()`           | `sendRedirect()`              |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Server/Client-Side | Server-side           | Client-side                   |
| URL Change         | No                    | Yes                           |
| Performance        | Faster (same request) | Slower (new request)          |
| Use Case           | Internal navigation   | Redirecting to external sites |

Example of `forward()`:

```java
RequestDispatcher rd = request.getRequestDispatcher("home.jsp");
rd.forward(request, response);
```

Example of `sendRedirect()`:

```java
response.sendRedirect("https://google.com");
```
